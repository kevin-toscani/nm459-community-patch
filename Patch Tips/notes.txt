1 - Player's graphics randomly glitchs?

	- set animations of player to the same number

		-e.g: if the walking animation is 6 frames...
		the idle animation must be 6 frames (no matter if there is substantially no animation)
			

2 - Appropiate size for playable area in MetroidVania - leave 1 tile free in both top and bottom of the screen. You will prevent any issues regarding transitions to vertical screens.
