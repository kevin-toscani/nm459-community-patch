# NESMaker 4.5.9 - Community patch

## Now you're creating with more power!

This patch smooths out several issues and aims to make NESMaker more user-friendly, especially for newcomers. For example, values like the coordinates for SpriteHUD or character physics can now be adjusted directly through UI constants, so you won’t have to dive into the code to make changes. Plus, there are input presets for all modules, letting you create a basic game setup with just a few clicks — especially convenient for long-beard users who get lazy with each new game.

While this patch doesn’t introduce new features like Game Over screens or effects like Light Rain, it keeps NESMaker as close to vanilla as possible, focusing primarily on stability and ease of use.

### ⚠ PROCEED WITH CAUTION ⚠​
You may only apply this patch on  **vanilla NESMaker**.  
You may not use this patch if you are already making a game unless you want to reset the development.

As with any patch, there may still be a few bugs, and it's very much a work in progress.  
I’d love to hear any feedback, suggestions, or recommendations for improving the code.  
This patch wouldn't have been possible without the support of this incredible community and the forums, whose contributions are credited throughout the code.
